AWS Project - Build a Full End-to-End Web Application

This a web application for a unicorn ride-sharing service called Wild Rydes ([Amazon workshop](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless-workshops)). The app will let us create an account and log in, then request a ride by clicking on a map (powered by ArcGIS).

AWS Services Used :
1. IAM
2. Amplify
3. Cognito
4. Lambda
5. API Gateway
6. DynamoDB

The Lambda function code is taken from [AWS workshop](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/module-3/ )
